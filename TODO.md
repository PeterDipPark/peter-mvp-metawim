# TODO

## Play Canvas

### DO:
1. DO: floating labels (PC, PP)
2. DO: global offset slider
3. DO: umbrella effect (Y folding of blades)
4. DO: flexible size with locked aspect ratio
5. DO: blades transparency and blending

### DONE:
1. DONE: model orbit/rotation drag
2. DONE: receive and execute commands from outside
3. DONE: fade slider: 
Now that we are able to layer PP and PC like this…is it possible to have a seamless transition between PC 3D model and PP 2D universe by dragging a slider? If so user could set a desired level of duality at any stage of the creative process. This would also replace the need the “mini viewer setup? I suggested earlier. And super great if we could even separate the PP landscape into two entities and have one slider control opacity of the circular center section/Universe…and another control opacity of the control dials surrounding it. This would allow user to fade away the PP universe/circles and still use PP controls to edit…both PPand PC would be affected but you would only see the live effect on PC. And then user could go one step further and “fade away ” the visibility of PP controls as well…and be left with a clean PC 3D model which can be orbited against a white canvas…while having floating labels providing info/metrics.

### extras:
1. mini window/representation of the WIMstar at all times when editing in PP - The  “mini window”/heads up display of the PC WIMstar inside PP edit mode … and vice versa.. the PP universe mini window heads up inside PC WIMstar mode….continuosly updated. This is a wish for item too…not crucial, and it does require functionality described below:
2. Having a series of predefined global states selected via a list/dropdown(the iPhone stuff etc)
3. Finally when it all works, we should look at adding beauty to the blades..if at all possible in PC…meaning the kind of render effects available in some game engines, eg. Shadows, lighting effects, outlines …this is definitely the last add on …if it is bought to produce beautiful realtime shading in PC I am fine with just having this interactivity working as it is..totally awesome. Wish for transparency tho.


### Next steps
In the next steps I think the focus will be on the WF page with PP/PC embeds and PP-PC states mapping.

### key points

There’s two elements I want to highlight …that maybe can be realized at least to some extent. 

1. (A) the general relationship we discussed between PP 2D geometry and PC 3D geometry…ideally these are completely linked, propagating both ways(PP reflects PC and vice versa) ...able to synchronize continuously. Meaning the WIMstar sliders( see below item B) will be an always active modeling tool.
2. (B) WIMstar macros…meaning (WF)sliders impacting current WIMstar profile pushing global profile(all 16 Blades towards certain global macros (iPhone etc)  …ideally this should also impact the PP 2D version(not crucial tho if this reverse pipeline is complex)

It just hit me that you already have this sliders/macros ability implemented as PC sliders. Maybe it is pretty easy to replicate( at least some of)  these sliders in WF. One simpler scenario could be that we offer 4 WF sliders as macros, driving all 16 PC sliders towards a limited set of macros. This would for example allow us to offer one slider driving the parameter "product design” (ie. Driving a set of  PC sliders towards an iPhone design. And another WF slider of 4 in total, driving a set of PC sliders towards a macro representing "engineering design”
